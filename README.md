# What some people think

    Some of the people think that whoever falls in the Bermuda Triangle goes through a giant hole where they are chewed, swallowed and crushed, others think they fall to the 
    bottom of a deep hole and without light stay there forever, others think that before they get there they are attacked by sea monsters and fall into the sea.

# What I believe

    I believe that if we fall into the Bermuda Triangle we fall near the center of the world.

# Note

    Let me know yet no one has proven what happens if we fall into the Bermuda Triangle, so I don't recommend trying to find out what happens, both because it's dangerous, and no 
    one knows what can really happen.
